# JS-Game-GuessThePrice
For those who are not familiar with this game, it is a question of guessing the price of a product. Here, three possibilities:

It's more expensive

It is less expensive

It's the right price!

In this version of "Fair Price", it will generate a random price, and it will calculate the number of moves it takes for a player to find the fair price. Thus, it will be able to confront his friends to try to see who finds the right price with the fewest possible moves!
